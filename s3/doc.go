// Package s3 is a go-storage provider over the S3 API. Its [Client]
// implements storage.Client over one bucket, built on aws-sdk-go-v2's
// service/s3 and feature/s3/transfermanager and authenticated with a static
// access key, and [New] constructs it. It is validated against SeaweedFS's S3 gateway. The
// sections below state how the Client maps storage's contract onto S3.
//
// # Construction
//
// [New] builds a [Client] from a finalized storage.Config without I/O.
// Container, Account, and Key are required: Container is the bucket, Account
// the access key ID, and Key the secret access key. Container must be a valid
// general purpose bucket name: 3 to 63 lowercase letters, digits, dots, and
// hyphens, starting and ending with a letter or digit, with no two dots
// together, not shaped like an IPv4 address, and free of the prefixes and
// suffixes S3 reserves.
//
//	client, err := s3.New(cfg)
//	if err != nil {
//		return err
//	}
//	store := storage.New(client, cfg)
//
// # Endpoints
//
// An empty Endpoint means AWS's own endpoint for the region, addressed
// virtual-hosted style as the SDK resolves it. A set Endpoint must be an
// absolute http or https URL. It becomes the SDK's base endpoint with
// path-style addressing, so the bucket is the first path segment, which is
// what an S3-compatible gateway such as SeaweedFS's expects.
//
// # Options
//
// Config.Options carries the provider's own settings, each overridable
// through storage.Env. Any key not listed here is ignored.
//
//   - region: the region the requests are signed for and, against AWS, the
//     region the bucket is created in. Unset means us-east-1. An S3-compatible
//     gateway usually accepts any region in the signature.
//   - max_retries: how many times the SDK retries a request that failed with
//     a transport error or a retryable answer (a 5xx status, a throttling
//     code), as a non-negative integer. 0 means one try. Unset keeps the SDK
//     default: three attempts, with jittered exponential backoff.
//   - part_size: the size of one part of a multipart upload, in bytes, from
//     5 MiB (5242880), S3's smallest part, to 5 GiB (5368709120), its
//     largest. Unset means 8 MiB. Put sends a body of up to one part as a
//     single PutObject and a longer one as a multipart upload. An upload
//     has at most 10,000 parts, so a body of unknown size can be at most
//     10,000 parts long, 80 GiB at the default; a declared Size raises the
//     part size as far as it needs.
//
// A malformed value is a construction error. The SDK's default checksum
// behavior is kept: a request carries a checksum when the operation
// supports one.
//
// # Containers
//
// [Client.EnsureContainer] sends CreateBucket, with the region as its
// location constraint everywhere but us-east-1, which takes none. It treats
// BucketAlreadyOwnedByYou as success. It treats BucketAlreadyExists as
// success only when a HeadBucket that follows it succeeds, because some
// gateways answer an owner's re-create with that code, while AWS uses it for
// a bucket another account owns. It never deletes or reconfigures a bucket.
// [Client.Probe] sends HeadBucket, which proves the endpoint, the
// credential, and the bucket together.
//
// # Keys
//
// [Client.Capabilities] declares the S3 key rules: a key is non-empty valid
// UTF-8 of at most 1,024 bytes. MaxKeyLength counts bytes, not runes. Put,
// Get, Stat, and Delete check their key against those rules before they
// send anything, and return the rule's error for a key that breaks one.
//
// # Objects
//
// [Client.Put] is all or nothing: the object appears whole, or Put fails
// and leaves any object at the key unchanged. It reads the body into memory
// through one part and one byte more, never further, to choose how to send
// it. A body of at most one part goes up as one PutObject with its length
// and content type, application/octet-stream when the caller gives none. A
// longer body, of declared or unknown size, goes up as a multipart upload
// through transfermanager, which streams the rest of the body a part at a
// time, holding a few parts in memory at once. An upload in progress is not
// an object: Get, Stat, and List do not see it until it completes, and its
// ETag then has the multipart form "<hex>-<parts>".
//
// A body that fails, or that is shorter or longer than a declared Size,
// fails Put. Within the first part, that is before any request. During a
// multipart upload, the upload is aborted, as it is when a part, the
// completion, or the caller's context fails: transfermanager aborts on a
// context of its own, and Put sends one AbortMultipartUpload more for the
// same upload, because transfermanager drops the error of an abort that
// fails after another failure, and S3 advises a repeat abort to free parts
// still in flight. An abort that still fails is named in Put's error,
// since the upload's parts may then remain until a lifecycle rule removes
// them. A body's failure is returned unclassified.
//
// Neither PutObject's answer nor CompleteMultipartUpload's carries a
// Last-Modified, so a HeadObject follows either for the ModifiedAt the
// other operations report; should that HeadObject fail, or see another
// writer's ETag, Put still succeeds and takes ModifiedAt from the write
// answer's Date header.
//
// [Client.Get] sends GetObject and streams its body. [Client.Stat] sends
// HeadObject. [Client.Delete] sends DeleteObject, which S3 answers with
// success for a missing key. [Client.List] sends ListObjectsV2 with the
// prefix, the continuation token, and the limit as max-keys, which S3 caps
// at 1,000; Page.Next is the next continuation token while the listing is
// truncated, and empty on the last page.
//
// Every operation reports the ETag in HTTP entity-tag form, adding the
// quotes to a value a gateway sends without them, so Put, Get, Stat, and
// List agree on one version's ETag. A listing's LastModified is truncated
// to the whole second, the precision of the Last-Modified header the
// others read.
//
// # Dependencies
//
// The module pins aws-sdk-go-v2's service/s3, its credentials and smithy-go,
// and feature/s3/transfermanager for multipart upload. transfermanager is
// v0 (v0.4.15), held as a stated exception the way go-observability holds
// otelhttp: AWS has not released it past v0, it is the maintained successor
// to the deprecated feature/s3/manager, it is maintained by the project
// that defines the ecosystem, and it adds no dependency beyond the SDK
// modules the package already compiles. A v0 minor may change its API, so
// an upgrade is checked against Put's use of it.
//
// # Errors
//
// Every method classifies the SDK's error in the dual form, so errors.As
// still reaches the SDK's smithy.APIError and its HTTP response error.
// NoSuchBucket matches storage.ErrContainerNotFound, and so does a 404 on a
// bucket request, whose HEAD answer carries no code. NoSuchKey matches
// storage.ErrNotFound. Stat's HeadObject answers a missing key and a missing
// bucket with the same bare 404, so a HeadBucket follows it: a missing
// bucket is storage.ErrContainerNotFound, an existing one makes the 404
// storage.ErrNotFound, and a HeadBucket that fails otherwise is classified
// on its own and never matches storage.ErrNotFound. A Get body's failed
// read is classified as a request's failure is. A 5xx answer, the
// SlowDown, ServiceUnavailable, and InternalError codes, and a failure with
// no response, an expired deadline included, match storage.ErrUnavailable.
// The caller's cancellation and every other answer, an authentication
// failure included, pass through unclassified.
//
// # Acceptance against SeaweedFS
//
// The unit tests run against a scripted HTTP server. The acceptance tests
// run go-storage's conformance suite, storagetest.Run and
// storagetest.RunMissingContainer, storage.Store.Start, Probe,
// EnsureContainer, the object operations, and multipart Put's visibility
// and abort, at 5 MiB parts, against a real gateway when
// S3_TEST_ENDPOINT names its URL, each in a bucket of its own, with the
// access key admin and the secret secret. The repository's mise tasks start
// SeaweedFS with those credentials and run them:
//
//	mise run seaweedfs:start
//	mise run acceptance
//	mise run seaweedfs:stop
